IP library for Arduino
====

## Description
IP library for Arduino

## Requirement
* arduino
    * If you want to run example sketch, you need arduino mega to use SerialX for RS485 connection. (If you need, please use gateway program [ip\_485\_gw](https://github.com/nkgami/ip_485_gw)
    * This example also need [protothreads](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/TutorialList#Timing).
    * for RS485 communication, I recommend using [LTC1485CN8](http://www.linear.com/purchase/LTC1485/LTC1485CN8%23PBF)

## Install
just put ARIP to libraries folder (in usual /usr/share/arduino/libraries)

## Usage
See examples/iprs485.ino (program for IP over RS485)
